# Trade Frequency Analysis Report - 2025-06-11

## Executive Summary

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: The MeanReversionRSI strategy implementation **ONLY uses RSI signals** and does NOT implement Bollinger Band filtering, despite Bollinger Band parameters being present in the configuration. This explains the extremely low trade frequency.

## Key Findings

1. **Raw RSI Signal Generation**: 1302 total RSI crossings in 2023
2. **Strategy Implementation Gap**: Bollinger Band filtering is configured but not implemented
3. **Actual Trade Count**: Only 4 trades executed (all in December 2023)
4. **Primary Bottleneck**: Missing Bollinger Band filter implementation, not overly restrictive parameters

## Signal Funnel Analysis

| Filter Stage | Potential Signals | Signals Passed | Signals Blocked | Block Rate |
|--------------|------------------|----------------|-----------------|------------|
| Raw RSI Crossings | 1302 | 1302 | 0 | 0.0% |
| + Bollinger Band Filter (Theoretical) | 1302 | 35 | 1266 | 97.2% |
| + Concurrent Trade Limit | 35 | 4 | 31 | 88.6% |
| **ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION** | 1302 | 4 | 1298 | 99.7% |

## Detailed Signal Analysis

### Raw RSI Signal Distribution
- **BUY Signals (RSI crosses above 35)**: 628
- **SELL Signals (RSI crosses below 65)**: 674
- **Total RSI Crossings**: 1302

### Monthly Signal Distribution
- **January**: 110 signals (52 BUY, 58 SELL)
- **February**: 116 signals (67 BUY, 49 SELL)
- **March**: 105 signals (45 BUY, 60 SELL)
- **April**: 92 signals (39 BUY, 53 SELL)
- **May**: 124 signals (68 BUY, 56 SELL)
- **June**: 120 signals (57 BUY, 63 SELL)
- **July**: 93 signals (43 BUY, 50 SELL)
- **August**: 134 signals (73 BUY, 61 SELL)
- **September**: 96 signals (48 BUY, 48 SELL)
- **October**: 110 signals (47 BUY, 63 SELL)
- **November**: 118 signals (51 BUY, 67 SELL)
- **December**: 84 signals (38 BUY, 46 SELL)

### Theoretical Bollinger Band Filter Impact
If Bollinger Band filtering were implemented as intended:
- **BUY signals with price <= Lower BB**: 18 / 628 (2.9%)
- **SELL signals with price >= Upper BB**: 17 / 674 (2.5%)
- **Total signals passing BB filter**: 35 / 1302 (2.7%)

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Implementation Gap
The strategy configuration includes Bollinger Band parameters:
- `bollinger_period`: 20
- `bollinger_std_dev`: 2.0

However, the `MeanReversionRSI` class implementation only checks:
1. RSI crossings (35/65 thresholds)
2. Optional trend filter (not configured)
3. Optional volatility filter (not configured)

**Missing Implementation**: Bollinger Band confirmation logic that should require:
- BUY signals: Price at or below Lower Bollinger Band
- SELL signals: Price at or above Upper Bollinger Band

### Secondary Issues
1. **Max Concurrent Trades**: Strategy limited to 2 concurrent positions
2. **Signal Timing**: Most RSI signals occur when price is NOT at Bollinger Band extremes
3. **December Concentration**: All 4 actual trades occurred in December 2023

## Strategic Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Implement Missing Bollinger Band Filter**: Add BB confirmation logic to `MeanReversionRSI.generate_signal()`
2. **Update Strategy Documentation**: Clarify that current implementation is RSI-only
3. **Configuration Cleanup**: Remove unused BB parameters or implement their usage

### Trade Frequency Optimization Options

**Option A: Implement Full Strategy (Recommended)**
- Add Bollinger Band filtering as originally intended
- Expected trade frequency: ~35 trades/year
- Maintains strategy integrity and risk management

**Option B: Relax RSI Thresholds**
- Change from 35/65 to 30/70 (would increase signals)
- Risk: May reduce signal quality and increase false signals

**Option C: Remove Bollinger Band Requirement**
- Keep current RSI-only implementation
- Expected trade frequency: ~1302 trades/year
- Risk: May increase false signals without BB confirmation

### Recommended Implementation
```python
# Add to MeanReversionRSI.generate_signal() after RSI crossing detection:

# Bollinger Band confirmation
bb_period = self.strategy_params.get("bollinger_period", 20)
bb_std = self.strategy_params.get("bollinger_std_dev", 2.0)
bbl_col = f'BBL_{bb_period}_{bb_std}'
bbu_col = f'BBU_{bb_period}_{bb_std}'

# For BUY signals: require price <= Lower BB
if signal_type == "BUY":
    if last_row['close'] > last_row[bbl_col]:
        return None  # Block signal

# For SELL signals: require price >= Upper BB  
if signal_type == "SELL":
    if last_row['close'] < last_row[bbu_col]:
        return None  # Block signal
```

## Conclusion

The extremely low trade frequency (4 trades/year) is primarily due to a **strategy implementation gap**, not overly restrictive parameters. The Bollinger Band filtering logic that should reduce false signals and improve trade quality is missing from the code.

Implementing the missing Bollinger Band filter would:
- Increase trade frequency to approximately 35 trades/year
- Improve signal quality by requiring price extremes
- Align implementation with strategy design intent
- Maintain risk management principles
