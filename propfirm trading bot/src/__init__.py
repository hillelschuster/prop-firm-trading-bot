# prop_firm_trading_bot/src/__init__.py

# This file makes 'src' a Python package.
# You can define a version for your bot package here, for example:
__version__ = "0.1.0"

# Optionally, you could expose some top-level classes for easier access if desired,
# but it's generally cleaner to import from specific modules.
# e.g., from .orchestrator import Orchestrator
