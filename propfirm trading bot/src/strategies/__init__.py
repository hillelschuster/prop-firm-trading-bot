# prop_firm_trading_bot/src/strategies/__init__.py

# This file makes 'strategies' a Python package.
# You can optionally expose strategy classes here for easier imports by the Orchestrator, e.g.:
# from .base_strategy import BaseStrategy
# from .trend_following_sma import TrendFollowingSMA
# from .mean_reversion_rsi import MeanReversionRSI

# For now, keeping it empty is fine. The Orchestrator will likely use full import paths
# based on the strategy_module and strategy_class defined in the configuration.
